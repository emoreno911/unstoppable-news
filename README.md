## Track
Storage Solutions for Web 3.0

## What it does
Unstoppable News is a combination of Hacker News, Pocket and censorship resistance. With our dApp anyone can create a backup of an article or post just by passing a url, the content will be stored in IPFS using Web3.Storage, that way the information will be available forever. To submit a new article you should connect your Metamask wallet using Rinkeby network and have some RinkebyETH to pay for the transaction. The dApp is deployed on Fleek to be fully decentralized. 

## How we built it
In the backend we used ExpressJS to work with the JSON article parser, the list of articles is stored in a smartcontract on Rinkeby  and for the frontend we used ReactJS with the Web3.Storage library to upload the files to IPFS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Make a dApp that is fully decentralized and censorship resistant.

## What we learned
- How IPFS works

## What's next for Unstoppable News
Given the nature of this concept estuary.tech should be a better fit for the dApp
